# BBGamepadControl
A script allowing the BigBrother robot to be manually controlled using a gamepad.

Part of a project work I did in university in 2022.


**Controls:**

Hold the left trigger on the gamepad to use the controls. If it is released while the robot is moving, emergency braking will be applied. If the controls are locked (left trigger is not held), the robot will not respong to the gamepad commands.

Left joystick (joycon) -- Movement (up/down -- forward/backwards; left-right -- turning). The robot accelerates and brakes smoothly.
